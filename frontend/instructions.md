# Frontend

Recreate the sample ui found in ui.png with just HTML and CSS. Using any libraries or css frameworks like bootstrap is not allowed.

Also implement the following functionality using JavaScript alone. jquery and other JavaScript libraries or frameworks are not allowed for this challenge.

- When a user clicks cancel, clear all the input boxes

- When a user clicks submit, first check to see if any of the input boxes are empty

- If any of the input boxes are empty, respond using window.alert with the message `all input boxes must be filled`.

- If all the input boxes are filled but the phone number field does not contain only numbers, respond using window.alert with the message `phone number field must only contain numbers`

- If all the input boxes are filled but the message field contains words more than 100 characters, respond using window.alert with the message `message field cannot have more than 100 characters`

- If all the conditions above are met then use window.alert with a message `welcome user`. Substitute user here with the value in the name input field.
