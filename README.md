# Week Two Task

The tasks given to you in the algorithms and frontend folders are to test how much you know about designing web pages with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and solving problems with JavaScript. The duration for the challenge is 3 days.

Look for an instructions.md file in each of the folders to guide your problem solving. Only edit the index.html, style.css, script.js and the function blocks inside the 5 challenge.js files.

Passing or failing these weekly assessments does not in anyway hinder your chances of getting into Decagon. We encourage you to try them out no matter how overwhelming they may look as we believe they will better prepare you.

Model solutions will be given in subsequent classes after the submission deadline is over.

`Happy Coding!!!`
